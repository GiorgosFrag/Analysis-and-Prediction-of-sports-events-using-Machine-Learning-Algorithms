In this project you will find an implementation of: 
(i) a linear (input - output) Artificial Neural Network, using as an input a 3 dimensional vector consisting of the betting company forecast for each team
(ii) a multilayer Artificial Neural Network, using as an input a 3 dimensional vector consisting of the betting company forecast for each team
(iii) a multilayer Artificial Neural Network, using as an input a 28 dimensional vector consisting of various features of each team given by the betting company

to predict the outcome of a football game (Home(1) - Draw(0) - Away(2))

(iv) K- means (K = 3) clustering algorithm
